    and Kumaon division. Kumaon is also spelt as Kumaun, is one of the regions of the state of Uttarakhand. 
    During the time of British control, between 1815 and 1817, it was known as Kemaon. Kumaon division 
    headquarters is located at lake city, Nainital. After the Independence of India in 1947, Kumaon became an
     administrative and revenue division in the Uttar Pradesh state until it was separated from Uttar
      Pradesh’s state and became an independent state Uttarakhand in the year 2000.<br><br>

 peaks because of its scenic views and beautiful hilly surroundings with tall trees, and it is a place
  of attraction for tourists from all over the world. In the Kumaon region, every river and mountain
   is related to one or another folktale. Kumaoni culture is all about folktales and countless 
   stories of Hindu Gods and Goddesses. The residents of Kumaon are known as Kumaonis, and they speak
    the Kumaoni language. Kumaoni people are brave, hardworking, and honest. Though the Kumaon region is
     associated with the Kumaoni people, there is a significant population of Kumaoni in Uttar Pradesh, 
     Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and some 
regions of Himachal Pradesh. Pahari people can also be found in Nepal, West Bengal, and North-Eastern India.

         Naula. A beautifully carved work on stone, Ek Hathiya Ka Naula is situated around 5 km from Champawat
          and it is said it was built in one night by a one-handed artisan. Locals say that Champawat gets its

Be it pilgrimages to one of the numerous revered sites of worship, enjoying a fun-filled picnic with family and friends at one of the lakes or just taking in the serene beauty of the surroundings – there is never a dull moment here. The uniqueness of this district lies in the fact that it is home to communities from several Indian states – Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and more – who live in harmony, reiterating the age-old saying 'unity in diversity'.

    The district headquarter is located in Rudrapur, which is said to have derived its name from king Rudra Chandra, a tribal chief. According to history, in 1588, Mughal emperor Akbar handed the land to king Rudra, who set up a military camp with the intention of ridding Terai of frequent invasions.
    
    A largely industrial and agricultural district, Udham Singh Nagar was a part of the Nainital district before it gained the identity of a separate district in October 1995. Known as the 'food bowl of Uttarakhand' and 'chawal ki nagari', the district was named in the memory of Late Shri Udham Singh, a great freedom fighter.
