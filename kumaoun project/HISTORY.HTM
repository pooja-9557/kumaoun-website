      <P>  Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas.
        Its peaks and valleys were known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous
        , and the source of the Ganges. The 27th state of Republic of India, Devbhoomi Uttarakhand that was
        formed in the year 2000 after being separated from the large state of Uttar Pradesh, is a
        destination to explore the riches of Indian culture, history, and natural beauty. The
        state that borders Tibet to the north; Nepal to the east; the state of Uttar Pradesh to the south;
        and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west, is divided into regions, Garhwal and Kumaon,
        which further break into 13 districts. 
        Earlier, the state was named UttaranchalUttarakhand is known as "the land of the gods" (Devbhumi)
        becauseof its number of Hindu pilgrimage sites.<BR>
        "The land of lord" ,actually it's unique because the person who doesn't believe 
        in god admire the presence of lord .The people of Uttarakhand  celebrates and 
        perform  rituals around the year due to their deep-rooted collection with nature and the rich
         mythology. Like their simple lifestyle, the festivals and fairs in Uttarakhand are also simple yet
          culturally rich. Each season is welcome with hearty folk songs and dance and so are the agricultural
           periods. The ancestor spirit worship is exclusive to the state, Jaagar, as it is locally called,
            is held to wake the Gods and the local deities up from their 
        inactive stage to solve their problems and shower on them many blessings.
