                        This lake and the town both got their names from the legendary Bhim of the Mahabharata fame. After the Anglo-Nepal war, the British government constructed a dam on this lake in 1883. The ruler of the Kumaon kingdom, Raja Baz Bahadur Chand, built the temple on the banks of this lake. Initially, this dam was built for irrigation purposes, but later it was used for drinking water. 

                            Different researchers have diverse opinions on the origin of this lake. However, the popular one is that the shifting of the numerous plates of the Earth’s crust created this lake. But the continuous pollution and sewage disposal are worsening the quality of the lake very severely.</P>
